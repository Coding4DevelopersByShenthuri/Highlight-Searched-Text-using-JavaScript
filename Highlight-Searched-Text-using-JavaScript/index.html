        Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer 
        science and engineering to design, construct, operate, and use 
        robots. These machines are capable of performing a variety of 
        tasks, either autonomously or under human guidance, by interpreting
        data from sensors and making decisions based on pre-defined 
        algorithms or artificial intelligence. Robotics has a wide range
        of applications, from manufacturing and healthcare to space 
        exploration and entertainment, continually pushing the boundaries
        of what machines can achieve in both the physical and digital realms.
